# Runtime ownership (A3 / A4)

`compact_kernel()` builds a 2-worker Tokio runtime for tests and in-process
demos. It is **not** the production I/O pool.

`sparrow-server` uses `host_kernel()` (`available_parallelism`, clamped 4–16)
for mailbox / stage futures.

Blocking work must stay off those async workers:

| Work | Where it runs |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite catalog (`Store::*`) | `Store::run_blocking` → Tokio blocking pool |
| Checkpoint encode / fsync / CURRENT | `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` on the aligned commit path |
| FileReplay `next_frame` / `decode_frame` | `spawn_blocking` in the aligned source loop |

A host that already owns a Tokio runtime should construct `Kernel` with that
process's `Handle` in a later change; until then the Kernel still owns a
dedicated runtime, but SQLite/checkpoint/file no longer sit on the 2 compact
async workers.

## Processing-time `now` (event-time future skew)

`WindowOperator::on_batch` / `WatermarkHub::observe_event` take `now` in
microseconds from `RuntimeClock`: host wall time on live jobs, or a
`SharedVirtualClock` in tests. That instant is **processing time**. It is
not event time and does not move the watermark.

When `max_future_skew` is set (ET windows default to one hour), a row
with `event_time > now + skew` is dropped, counted as
`RuntimeMetrics.future_dropped` (`GET /v1/metrics`), and must not advance
`max_et` (P0-5).
